This package contains an implementation of the sparse
deconvolution algorithm described in the paper:
A. Levin, R. Fergus, F. Durand and W. T. Freeman:
Image and Depth from a Conventional Camera with a 
Coded Aperture, SIGGRAPH 2007. 

A detailed tutorial and documentation of this algorithm
is available on our project page:  
http://groups.csail.mit.edu/graphics/CodedAperture/SparseDeconv-LevinEtAL07.pdf

Usage of this code is free for research goals only.
